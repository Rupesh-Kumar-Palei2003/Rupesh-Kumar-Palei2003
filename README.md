- ⚡ Fun fact: Why did the private classes break up?  Because they never saw each other.
- I like this funny programmer joke, because you need an intermediate knowledge of Java to understand the punchline.
Java has a variety of access modifiers, one of which is private.

The private access modifier greatly limits the visibility of a class, method or variable. If two classes were private, are compiler won’t allow them to reference, or “see” each other.
And of course, if a couple could never see each other, they’d surely break up, which is why this Java programming joke is funny.
